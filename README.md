Requires `node`. Run `npm install` from the main directory to install
the build tools.

The source files are in `src/`. Published files (generated by the build) live in `dist/`.

## Building and development

You can build the published files by running `npm run build`. That will compile
the JSX to JavaScript and copy the other source files.

Run `npm run watch` to have a server continuously watching the source,
re-publishing whenever there are changes.
