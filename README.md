# ellipsis.ai public website

Requires `ruby 2.4.1` and the `bundler` gem. (Use `rbenv` to install it if you don't already have it.)

The source files are in `src/`. Published files (generated by the build) live in `dist/`.

## Setup

`brew install rbenv`
`rbenv install`
`gem install bundler`
`bundle`

## Building and development

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to have a server continuously watching the source,
re-publishing whenever there are changes.
