# NOTE 1: Using the official jekyll docker did not work since we use jekyll-less
# which requires therubyracer which requires some version of the Javascript V8
# engine that is NOT compatible with Linux Alpine.
#
# NOTE 2: busybox is used to cache the gems so we do not have to bundle install
# everytime we start the container.
